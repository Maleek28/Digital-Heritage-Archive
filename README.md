# Digital-Heritage-Archive

Project Title
Digital Heritage Archive: A GitHub-Based Metadata and Access System for Historical Artifacts

1. Rationale
The goal is to develop an open-access, version-controlled, and community-contributable system for storing, organizing, and describing digitized historical artifacts. GitHub offers versioning, collaboration, and transparency, making it an ideal backend for this prototype system.

2. User Group Definition
Primary Users:

Educators in humanities fields

Archivists and museum curators

Digital humanities researchers

Undergraduate and graduate students

3. Information Needs of User Group
Users need:

Consistent metadata for easy retrieval and citation.

Clear hierarchical structures to reflect physical or thematic organization.

Version tracking for historical documents and community contributions.

Downloadable formats for offline teaching and research use.

4. Gaps in Information Provision
Many digital collections are locked behind proprietary systems.

Few allow for community contribution, version control, or forked exploration.

Lack of easily navigable and structured formats for integrating into educational settings.

5. Criteria for Evaluating the System (Use Cases)
Use Case 1: A history professor uses the collection to build a course module on printing history.

Use Case 2: A student downloads metadata to analyze cultural trends across manuscripts using text mining.

Use Case 3: A museum curator forks the repository to localize descriptions in another language and add region-specific artifacts.

6. System Specifications
All metadata will follow Dublin Core standards.

All files will be in Markdown or JSON format for transparency and interoperability.

Folder hierarchy: collection/ > exhibits/ > items/

Contributors can submit pull requests to add new metadata or items.

CI tools will validate metadata structure (e.g., JSON schema linting).

7. Objectives
Create a publicly accessible and browsable archive of at least 5 digitized cultural artifacts.

Allow versioned contributions to item metadata.

Provide structured access for research, education, and preservation.

8. System Development
Tools: GitHub, GitHub Pages (for display), JSON schema, Markdown, Git LFS (if media-heavy)

Structure: Hierarchical file/folder system

Metadata: Dublin Core–inspired

Access: Web and raw file access

9. Field Testing and Dissemination
Run a beta pilot with 2-3 educators and researchers to test usability.

Share via academic mailing lists and GitHub topic tags (#digital-humanities, #archives).

Solicit issues/feedback on GitHub Issues.
