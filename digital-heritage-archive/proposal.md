# Project Proposal: Digital Heritage Archive

## Rationale

This system was developed to preserve, organize, and share digital versions of rare historical texts and manuscripts. The goal is to facilitate research, education, and public engagement with cultural heritage artifacts in digital form.

## User Group

The primary user group includes:
- Academics and researchers in history, archaeology, and literature
- Educators and students in the humanities
- Museum and archive professionals
- The general public interested in cultural heritage

## Information Needs

Users need:
- Accurate and trustworthy descriptions of historical artifacts
- Structured metadata for research and citation
- Thematic grouping and context (e.g., by collection, region, period)
- Open access to digital records

## Gaps in Information Provision

- Limited availability of unified, digital, open-access archives
- Inconsistent metadata across repositories
- Lack of engaging, contextual materials for non-specialists

## Evaluation Criteria (Use Cases)

1. **Research Citation**: A graduate student uses metadata to cite the Shakespeare First Folio in a thesis.
2. **Curriculum Design**: A high school teacher uses item descriptions in a world history unit.
3. **Public Exhibition**: A museum uses structured metadata to tag an online gallery.

## System Specifications

- Markdown for human-readable descriptions
- JSON metadata for machine-readability and indexing
- GitHub for public version control and access
- Folder-based structure for organizing content hierarchically

## Objectives

- Preserve key historical documents in digital form
- Support scholarship and education through open access
- Encourage reuse and remixing of metadata in other systems

## Development Process

- Items were selected for historical and pedagogical value
- Each item includes a descriptive markdown file and structured JSON
- Items are grouped by thematic collection (e.g., print vs. manuscript)

## Field Testing and Dissemination

- Shared with educators for feedback
- Published on GitHub for public access and contribution
- Promoted via academic and cultural heritage networks

## Timeline and Skills Needed

- Week 1: Content selection and research
- Week 2: Metadata design and file structuring
- Week 3: GitHub setup and publication
- Week 4: Outreach and feedback collection

**Skills Required**: Content research, metadata standards (Dublin Core, schema.org), Git/GitHub, writing for web, public engagement
