# Digital Heritage Archive

This repository serves as a digital archive for significant historical documents and manuscripts. It includes two primary collections:

- **Early Prints**: Featuring landmark works in the history of printing.
- **Ancient Manuscripts**: Preserving handwritten texts from ancient civilizations.

Each item is presented with a human-readable description (`item.md`) and structured metadata (`metadata.json`).
